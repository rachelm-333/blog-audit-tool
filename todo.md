- [x] Pre-launch checklist review: RESEND_FROM_EMAIL, Stripe live keys, Blog Batcher URL, env vars documented

## Bug Fixes (June 2026)

- [x] Fix Free Audit page (/audit) — stuck on "Auditing..." for Wix/JS-rendered pages due to Puppeteer timeout; replace with fast HTTP fetch + better error messaging
- [x] Fix Audit All button disabled — add keyword.bulkSuggest tRPC procedure to AI-suggest keywords for all posts without one; add "Suggest Keywords for All" button to PostList UI
- [x] Add tooltip/explanation to Audit All button explaining why it requires keywords

## Bug Fixes — Free Audit Scraper (Wix Pages)

- [x] Fix Puppeteer scraper to use networkidle2 instead of networkidle0 (Wix never reaches networkidle0 due to analytics calls)
- [x] Add DOM-based content extraction using page.evaluate() with priority selectors ([data-hook="post-description"] for Wix, then article, main)
- [x] Fix keyword auto-extraction from page title when no meta keyword found
- [x] Update AuditResults UI to show auto-detected keyword as a green confirmed badge (not a scary warning)
- [x] Add "Change" button to let user override the auto-detected keyword
- [x] Clean up TypeScript errors from scraper refactor

## Bug Fixes — Audit Check Accuracy (False Negatives)

- [x] Fix P9 (Opening Answer Block): pass plain text opening 500 words to AI, explicitly instruct AI to look in body not title
- [x] Fix P10 (External Authority Link): mechanically pre-extract all external links from HTML and pass as a clean list to AI
- [x] Fix P15 (Human Authenticity): pass plain text body (not raw HTML with CSS/JS noise) to AI
- [x] Fix P16 (Article Type Structure): raise cornerstone ceiling from 3,200 to 5,000 words (13-min reads are valid cornerstone articles)
- [x] Add Re-audit button (re-runs audit on same URL without clearing results)
- [x] Add "Audit a different post" / Clear button (clears results and URL, scrolls back to top)
- [x] Fix P11 (Internal CTA Link): mechanically pre-extract all internal links and pass as a list; broaden CTA detection to include product-page, store, and any non-blog internal link with CTA anchor text
- [x] Fix P12 (Internal Blog Link): use mechanically pre-extracted internal links list; AI now has the full list to check against
- [x] Add extractInternalLinks() helper that identifies internal links by domain match or relative path, excludes self-links to current post URL

## Bug Fixes — Rewrite Engine

- [x] Fix critical bug: rewrite engine was returning success:false and showing "credits refunded" without ever displaying the rewritten article
- [x] Fix: always save and deliver the best rewrite result regardless of score; needsManualReview flag shown as a notice, not a blocker
- [x] Fix: when retry scores higher than first attempt, pick the best result (not just the retry)
- [x] Fix: retry catch block now saves first attempt result before refunding
- [x] Improve Pass 1 prompt: explicit mandatory structure for P9 (opening answer block with exact HTML example), P10 (external authority link with acceptable sources), P11 (CTA link with exact URLs), P12 (internal blog link), P14 (E-E-A-T with 2+ required signals), P15 (banned phrases list)
- [x] Improve Pass 1 prompt: word count is now marked MANDATORY with instruction to count carefully
- [x] Improve Pass 1 prompt: Australian English spelling rules explicitly stated

## Bug Fixes — Rewrite Quality (Target 14-16/16)

- [x] Add post-rewrite mechanical enforcement for P9 (opening answer block injection if missing)
- [x] Fix re-scoring audit to use plain text + internal link extraction (same as free audit fixes)
- [x] Add mechanical enforcement for P11 (inject CTA link if AI omitted one)
- [x] Add mechanical enforcement for P12 (inject internal blog link if AI omitted one)
- [x] Add mechanical enforcement for P13 (inject schema JSON-LD into body before re-scoring so P13 always passes)
- [x] Fix ARTICLE_TYPE_TARGETS in rewrite service to match audit service (cornerstone 2500-5000, pillar 1500-2499, cluster 800-1499)
- [x] Fix inferArticleType thresholds to match (>=2500 cornerstone, >=1500 pillar)
- [x] Run mechanical enforcement twice: once after Pass 1, once after Pass 2 fingerprint scrub (to catch regressions)
- [x] Raise rewrite target threshold from 13 to 14 in the router

## Bug Fixes — Word Count Targets & Editor UX

- [x] Fix word count targets: Cornerstone 2500-3200 (±50), Pillar 1500-1800 (±50), Cluster 1000-1200 (±50) — updated both audit.service.ts and rewrite.service.ts
- [x] Fix rewrite engine to target the midpoint of the word count range (not just minimum)
- [x] Add "Re-run Rewrite" button to the post editor page (amber button in header, uses stored paaQuestion, deducts 1 credit)
- [x] Add rewrite.rerunRewrite tRPC procedure to the rewrite router
- [x] Fix invisible header buttons in post editor (now slate-800 bg with slate-200 text — clearly visible on dark navy)
- [x] Fix HTML output spacing: added instruction to place blank line between every heading and paragraph
- [x] Preserve original images in rewrite: added PRESERVE ALL IMAGES instruction to Pass 1 prompt
- [x] Fix saveEdits re-scoring: now passes business primaryCtaUrl so P11 scores correctly
- [x] Fix saveEdits score counting: now counts pass + na (not just pass) to match audit service semantics
- [x] Add paaQuestion and articleType to getPostForReview query so review page can access them

## Feature — Editor Sidebar SEO Breakdown

- [x] Add SeoScorePanel component to ReviewEdit sidebar: shows all 16 points with pass/fail/unable-to-score grouped sections
- [x] Failing points shown first in red with the exact reason (note field) so user knows what to fix
- [x] Passing points shown in green (collapsible, expanded by default)
- [x] Panel collapses/expands via "Point Breakdown" toggle button
- [x] currentAuditPoints state initialised from post.auditResults on load, updated on every save
- [x] saveEdits onSuccess now updates currentAuditPoints from the re-score response
- [x] Fix saveEdits: now passes business primaryCtaUrl and counts na as passing (already done in previous batch)

## Bug Fixes — Concrete Code Fixes (Rewrite Engine)

- [x] Fix saveRewriteResult to also save auditResults/auditScore/auditGrade so retries and editor use the latest audit breakdown (not the original pre-rewrite audit)
- [x] Fix retry logic: retry now uses failing points from the FIRST REWRITE result, not the original audit (which has different failures)
- [x] Fix rerunRewrite procedure: now also auto-retries once if score < 14, using failing points from first attempt
- [x] Add P10 mechanical enforcement fallback: if AI omitted an external authority link, inject a business.gov.au link as last resort
- [x] Fix P12 blog link detection: now matches Wix-style /post/slug paths (no trailing slash required) in both audit service and rewrite enforcement
- [x] Wire externalAuthorityFallback into both enforcement passes (Pass 1 and Pass 2) in runFullRewrite

## Feature — Review & Edit Redesign + Approval Workflow

- [x] Fix AI fabrication: extract CTA section and FAQ section from original body before rewrite; pass them as protected zones with instruction to preserve verbatim — extractProtectedSections() implemented; originalCtaSection and originalFaqSection passed to Pass 1 prompt with PRESERVE VERBATIM instructions
- [x] Add approval workflow status transitions: awaiting_review → approved → published (DB migration + router procedures)
- [x] Add Review Queue page: shows only posts with status awaiting_review, grouped by article type, with Approve/Edit buttons
- [x] Redesign ReviewEdit page: three-column layout (post queue left, rendered article centre, editable SEO fields right)
- [x] Fix article rendering in centre panel: proper spacing between headings and paragraphs, bold headings visible
- [x] Add AI edit window in centre panel: text input where user types an instruction (e.g. "restore original FAQ section") and AI applies targeted edit
- [x] Add Approve button in ReviewEdit page that moves post to approved status
- [x] Add "Approve All" button on Review Queue page
- [x] Post list: add filter tabs for awaiting_review / approved / published / all

## Feature — Approval Workflow & Review Queue

- [x] Fix AI fabrication: add extractProtectedSections() to extract CTA and FAQ sections from original body verbatim
- [x] Wire protected sections into Pass 1 prompt with PRESERVE VERBATIM instructions
- [x] Add awaiting_review and approved to rewriteStatus enum in schema.ts
- [x] Apply migration for new rewrite_status enum values
- [x] saveRewriteResult now sets rewriteStatus to awaiting_review when score >= 14 (auto-queues for review)
- [x] Add getReviewQueuePosts() to dashboard.db.ts
- [x] Add getReviewQueue and approvePost tRPC procedures to dashboard router
- [x] Create ReviewQueue page (ReviewQueue.tsx): three-column layout with post list left, article info centre, SEO details right
- [x] Posts grouped by article type (Cornerstone, Pillar, Cluster) in the left panel
- [x] Approve All button and individual Approve + Edit in Editor buttons
- [x] Add Review Queue link to sidebar navigation (ClipboardCheck icon)
- [x] Add /review-queue route to App.tsx

## Bug Fixes — Data Accuracy (June 2026)

- [x] Fix Review Queue threshold: queue posts where original audit_score >= 14, not rewrite_score >= 14
- [x] Fix dashboard "issues" count: show count of FAILING points only, not total 16 points
- [x] Fix ReviewEdit score display: ensure original audit score and rewrite score are read from correct DB columns (audit_score vs rewrite_score)
- [x] Fix saveEdits re-score: when only meta title/description changes (body unchanged), do NOT re-score — just save the meta fields and return the existing score/grade/points unchanged

## Feature — Manual Action Callouts for P6 and P12

- [x] P6 (Keyword in URL): when failing, show a "Manual action required" callout in the SEO point breakdown AND in the Approve & Post Back confirmation screen explaining the URL slug must be updated in the CMS after publishing, with a short example of a keyword-rich URL structure
- [x] P12 (Internal Blog Link): when failing, show a callout explaining the content hierarchy (cluster → pillar → cornerstone) and that the internal link must point to an already-published live post to avoid broken links

## Bug Fix — Image Preservation on Post-Back

- [x] Preserve original images in post-back: extract img tags from the original stored body and re-inject them into the rewritten body at the same relative positions before sending to Wix, WordPress, or Shopify — preserveImagesInBody() implemented in postback.service.ts and called in both postBackToWordPress() and postBackToShopify(); Wix uses separate Ricos IMAGE node merge

## Bug Fix — Image Preservation on Post-Back

- [x] Preserve original images in post-back: extract img tags from the original stored body and re-inject them at proportionally equivalent positions in the rewritten body before sending to Wix, WordPress, or Shopify

## Feature — Obfuscate Audit Point Descriptions (Protect Proprietary 16-Point System)

- [x] Replace all verbose mechanical note strings in audit.service.ts with minimal non-revealing labels (no thresholds, no ranges, no targets)
- [x] Replace AI-generated note instructions so the LLM returns minimal non-revealing notes for P9–P12, P14–P15
- [x] Remove p.note display from passing points in PostList AuditResultsPanel (just show green tick + name)
- [x] Remove p.note display from passing points in Audit.tsx public page (just show green tick + name)
- [x] Remove p.note display from passing points in ReviewEdit SeoScorePanel (already no note shown — verified, notes never rendered for passing points)

## UX Fix — CMS Connections Page & Sidebar

- [x] Fix CMS Connections page: after adding a connection, do NOT auto-redirect to Import Posts — return user to the Connections list with a success state and a clear "Import Posts" button they can choose to click
- [x] Redesign Connections list: each connected CMS shows its platform icon, site name/URL, status badge (connected/error), and action buttons: "Import Posts", "Edit Credentials", "Remove" — no ambiguous labels
- [x] Fix duplicate Startup Deck entries in the sidebar navigation (deduplicate by name client-side)

## UX Fix — Approved Post Workflow

- [x] Hide "Fix this post" / "Fix for a credit" button from posts that are already in approved status
- [x] Add a clear "Publish to CMS" button on approved posts so user can push the rewritten post back to their CMS
- [x] Ensure the post detail/review page for an approved post shows its approved status clearly (not just the audit score)

## UX Fix — Publish to CMS Feedback
- [x] Return a `publishedLive` boolean and `postUrl` from the postback router so the frontend knows if the publish step actually completed
- [x] Show clear success toast: "Content updated and published to Wix" with a "View live post" link when both steps succeed
- [x] Show warning toast: "Content saved but not published — please publish manually from Wix" when draft saved but publish step failed

## Bug — CMS Connection Status Drops (FIXED)
- [x] Diagnose why Wix connection keeps losing "connected" status — root cause: any import error (even transient) was setting connection_status to "error"
- [x] Fix import catch block in cms.ts — only set "error" for credential/auth failures (invalid_credentials), not for transient network or data errors
- [x] Fix testConnection catch block in cms.ts — same rule, only auth failures set "error"
- [x] Fix postback.ts — only set "error" for insufficient_permissions, not for site_unreachable (transient)
- [x] Fix error message to be platform-aware (say "Wix" not "WordPress" for Wix connections)
- [x] Manually reset the broken Wix connection (id: lyvbsh7MjLps5AD_jTun1) back to "connected" in the database

## Critical Bug — Wix Post-Back Destroys Images and Formatting
- [x] Fix Wix post-back: preserve all original images from the Wix post (fetch original richContent nodes and merge image nodes back in)
- [x] Fix Wix post-back: ensure paragraph spacing is correct (each paragraph separated properly, headings have correct spacing)
- [x] Fix htmlToRicos converter: produce proper Wix richContent paragraph nodes with correct spacing

## Safety Gate — Wix Post-Back Image Protection
- [x] Add pre-flight check in postBackToWix: if original draft has images but final richContent nodes contain zero IMAGE nodes, abort with error_code "image_loss_risk"
- [x] Show a blocking warning toast in the UI when image_loss_risk fires: "Post-back blocked — images could not be preserved. Please contact support."

## Bug — Wix Post-Back Spacing and Title
- [x] Fix paragraph spacing in Wix post-back — confirmed this is a Wix theme CSS setting, not controllable via Ricos API; user must adjust paragraph spacing in Wix Editor blog theme settings
- [x] Stop post title from being overwritten — fixed by stripping H1 from rewritten body before converting to Ricos; Wix blog uses its own title field, H1 in body was appearing as duplicate heading
- [x] Verify AI citation block is placed in the first paragraph of the rewritten content — confirmed in rewrite.service.ts prompt, PAA question + answer block is injected at the very start of body

## Bug — Wix Ricos Paragraph Spacing
- [x] Inspect native Wix draft post Ricos node structure to find correct spacing format
- [x] Update htmlToRicos to produce spacing-correct Ricos nodes matching native Wix format — insert empty PARAGRAPH spacer nodes between every block element

## Bug — Manual Review Fallback (13/16 after 2 attempts)
- [x] Diagnose which 3 points consistently fail after two rewrite attempts — P4 (no H3 enforcement), P14 (E-E-A-T stripped by Pass 2), P15 (banned phrases reintroduced by Pass 2)
- [x] Fix the rewrite prompt or mechanical enforcement so those points reliably pass — added P4 H3 mechanical enforcement; strengthened Pass 2 prompt to preserve E-E-A-T signals and ban AI phrases
- [x] Ensure the 15/16 threshold is achievable in 2 attempts for typical posts — mechanical enforcement now covers P1, P3, P4, P5, P7, P8, P9, P10, P11, P12, P13 (11 of 16 points guaranteed)

## Critical Bug Fixes — Post-Back Quality (June 2026)

- [x] Add FAQ/CTA preservation toggles to the rewrite modal: two checkboxes "Preserve FAQ section as-is" (default ON) and "Preserve CTA section as-is" (default ON); pass these as preserveFaq and preserveCta booleans through the rewrite router to runFullRewrite
- [x] Wire preserveFaq/preserveCta through runFullRewrite and Pass 1 prompt: when OFF, allow AI to rewrite that section; when ON (default), extract and pass verbatim as protected zone
- [x] Fix Wix spacing: the spacer PARAGRAPH is being inserted BETWEEN every block AND empty <p> tags in the HTML are also being converted to PARAGRAPH nodes — resulting in double/triple spacing. Fix: only insert ONE spacer between blocks; skip the spacer if the preceding node is already an empty PARAGRAPH
- [x] Fix image placement on post-back: instead of scattering images at proportional positions throughout the rewritten body, move ALL preserved images to the TOP of the post body (after the first paragraph), with a visible note in the UI: "Images have been placed at the top of your post — please reposition them in your CMS editor"

## Cross-CMS Post-Back Consistency (June 2026)

- [x] Audit Shopify post-back: confirm preserveImagesInBody (top-of-post placement) is called and spacing is clean — confirmed, already using preserveImagesInBody
- [x] Audit Zapier/webhook post-back: confirm FAQ/CTA preservation, image placement, and spacing rules apply — added preserveImagesInBody call to postBackViaZapier; bodyOriginal and bodyImageAlts now passed from router
- [x] Add image-placement notice to post-back success UI: blue notice card shown in PostBackConfirmation when post had images; wording adapts to Wix/Shopify/WordPress/Zapier
- [x] Confirm spacing rule (one blank line between blocks only) applies to WordPress and Shopify HTML output — WordPress and Shopify use raw HTML (no Ricos nodes); spacing is controlled by the CMS renderer, not by iAudit. Wix spacing fix applied in previous session.

## Review Queue Filter Fix (June 2026)

- [x] Fix review queue: posts with postBackStatus === "complete" should only appear in the "Published" tab — exclude them from "All", "Awaiting Review", and "Approved" tabs and their counts

## Bug Fix — Rewrite Truncation (June 2026)

- [x] Fix rewrite truncating mid-content: increase max_tokens on Pass 1 LLM call; add post-completion guard that re-appends preserved FAQ/CTA sections if they are missing from the output — max_tokens now explicitly set to 32768 on Pass 1 call; invokeLLM now honours caller-supplied max_tokens; safety net appends CTA/FAQ back if LLM truncated them

## Bug Fix — Meta Title & Description Hard Limits (June 2026)

- [x] Enforce hard character limits on meta title (40–60 chars) and meta description (140–160 chars): (1) Pass 1 prompt now has HARD LIMIT labels with explicit count instructions and NEVER use ellipsis rule; (2) P7 enforcement trims to last complete word within 60 chars, rebuilds with keyword prefix if needed; (3) P8 enforcement trims to last complete sentence within 160 chars, pads naturally if under 140 — ellipsis never produced

## Bug Fix — Live Edit Audit Score Drop (June 2026)

- [x] Fix audit score recalculating incorrectly during manual editing: link checks (internal link, external authority link, CTA link) must NOT re-evaluate against the live editor text — they should remain locked to the last saved/approved score. Only content-length and keyword-density checks should update live. Removing a few words must never drop a link-based check that was already passing. — FIXED: saveEdits now extracts all href values from prev and new body; if the link set is identical, P10/P11/P12 are locked to stored passing results before the score is returned.
